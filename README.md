Small Python project used to prototype and test a Tetris-style game loop.

The repository contains:

main.py: entry point that starts the application.

tetris.py: core game logic (state updates, piece behavior, loop).

The goal is not polish or completeness, but rapid experimentation with structured Python code, event loops, and simple game mechanics.
This was also used as a sandbox for testing AI-assisted coding workflows.

Run
python main.py


Python 3.8+ required. No external dependencies.

Scope

Minimal, self-contained, and intentionally lightweight.
Designed for learning, testing ideas, and breaking things safely.
